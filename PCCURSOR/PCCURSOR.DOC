	PCcursor.cpp for Borland C++
	============================


	Thank you for downloading pccursor.zip.  The 
	CursorShape class provides you with an easy way to
	control the cursor shapes in multiple windows of
	your program and insure that the original shape(s)
	are restored thanks to destructors.

	Compile and run pccursor.cpp.  The demo will show
	the various cursor shapes.  The source code shows
	how to call CursorShape member functions.  To
	use pccursor.cpp in your application be sure to
	comment out "#define TEST_PCCURSOR_CPP" near the end
	of the file.
