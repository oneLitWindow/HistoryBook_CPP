    Mouse++ is a mouse interface class for Borland C++ or TurboC++. The
distributed files are:

	mouse.h		header file for Mouse++
	mouse.cpp	source code for Mouse++
	cgc.cpp		source for ColorGraphicsCursors
	cgc_bgi.cpp	BGI version of ColorGraphicsCursors
	cursor.h	text & graphic cursor definitions
	mouse.lib	library of all mouse functions (large model)
	demo.cpp	text/graphics demo
	mouse.doc	documentation file
	mouse.his	revision history
	readme		this file

A demonstration of most of the functions for both text mode and gra-
phics (EGA/VGA) mode is contained in demo.cpp. To run the demo, simply 
compile and link it with mouse.lib (you will also need EGAVGA.BGI for 
the graphics demo).
